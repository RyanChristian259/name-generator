#Name Generator App

##A Project by Ryan Ciecalone

###Objective and description
The objective of Name Generator is to create a fun app that allows the end user to enter their name and select from several categories that will generate a new themed name based on entered value.

For example: If I tell the app that I want a pirate name and I enter "Ryan Ciecalone" it might return "Rrrrrgh Captain!" or "Pirate Ferdinand the Fearless."

I also have a stretch goal of testing a generated name to see if the name is available as a domain name.
More than one list.  Pig latin type naming...  Possibly anagram solver for names.

###A list of technologies that you plan to use
-Bootstrap and CSS structure and styling.
-HTML for text content.
-Javascript for the name generator program and DOM manipulation.
 -TDD with Jasmine, JSON, AJAX, and (possibly) a domain name API.

###A well-defined and written-out feature list
